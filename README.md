### Project 2: Exploring Climate Change Trends in Kenya 1960 to 2022

**Key Takeaways:**
The findings highlight a worrisome:
- escalation in CO2 emissions,
- persistent growth in urban population,
- alarming reduction in forest cover, and
- a concerning downturn in renewable energy consumption.
These observations underscore the urgency for sustainable environmental practices and informed policymaking to address the evolving climate challenges in Kenya.

**Technologies Used:**
Power BI and its inbuilt M language.

### Project 4: Examining Patient Risk of Developing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) within the Next 10 Years

**Description:**
This project is crucial for healthcare intervention planning, utilizing **Python** (for meticulous data cleaning and joining) and **Power BI** (for effective visualization). By examining patient data, it offers valuable insights into specific risk categorie, guiding the development of tailored healthcare interventions and preventive measures against the potential development of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) over the next decade.
